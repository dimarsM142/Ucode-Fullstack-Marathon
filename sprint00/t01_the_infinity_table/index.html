                    its whereabouts (which she burnt) but kept this a secret from Thanos. </td>

                        of the green Time Stone contained inside. After being stored for an 
                        unknown amount of time on a pedestal in Kamar-Taj, it was recently

                    if used correctly. The unique element that composes the Tesseract has also been

                    computer module, which also masked the stone's presence. Stark originally saw the 
                    Stone as a power source, whereas once J.A.R.V.I.S. had the opportunity to study the 
                    stone he stated it was more akin to a very powerful computer. The stone within had already 
                    been in the possession of Thanos when he gave it to Loki to aid him in his invasion of Earth. </td>

                    obliterate an entire planet when unleashed. This stone was sought by Thanos, who tasked Ronan the
