        <h2 id ="first-header">What makes a superhero?</h2>   
        <p>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability 
            to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to
            be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional 
            than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you 
            need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, 
            a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
            <br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a 
            regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
            But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, 
            it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something 
            that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then 
            I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>
